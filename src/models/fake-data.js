      description:"The latest edition of the essential text and professional reference, with substantial new material on such topics as vEB trees, multithreaded algorithms, dynamic programming, and edge-based flow. ##\
Some books on algorithms are rigorous but incomplete; others cover masses of material but lack rigor. Introduction to Algorithms uniquely combines rigor and comprehensiveness. The book covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor. ##\
The first edition became a widely used text in universities worldwide as well as the standard reference for professionals. The second edition featured new chapters on the role of algorithms, probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms, and linear programming. The third edition has been revised and updated throughout. It includes two completely new chapters, on van Emde Boas trees and multithreaded algorithms, substantial additions to the chapter on recurrence (now called “Divide-and-Conquer”), and an appendix on matrices. It features improved treatment of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms and a new notion of edge-based flow in the material on flow networks. Many exercises and problems have been added for this edition. The international paperback edition is no longer available; the hardcover is available worldwide.",

      description:"The authors present the complete guide to ANSI standard C language programming. Written by the developers of C, this new version helps readers keep up with the finalized ANSI standard for C while showing how to take advantage of C's rich set of operators, economy of expression, improved control flow, and data structures. The 2/E has been completely rewritten with additional examples and problem sets to clarify the implementation of difficult language constructs. For years, C programmers have let K&R guide them to building well-structured and efficient programs. Now this same help is available to those working with ANSI compilers. Includes detailed coverage of the C language plus the official C language reference manual for at-a-glance help with syntax notation, declarations, ANSI changes, scope rules, and the list goes on and on.",

      description: "THIS BOOK COVERS:\
      Basic programming concepts - assuming no prior knowledge of programming beyond an ability to create a web page using HTML & CSS\
      Core elements of the JavaScript language - so you can learn how to write your own scripts from scratch\
      jQuery - which will allow you to simplify the process of writing scripts (this is introduced half-way through the book once you have a solid understanding of JavaScript)\
      How to recreate techniques you will have seen on other web sites such as sliders, content filters, form validation, updating content using Ajax, and much more (these examples demonstrate writing your own scripts from scratch and how the theory you have learned is put into practice).\
      As with our first book (the best-selling HTML & CSS: Design and Build Websites), each chapter:\
      Breaks subjects down into bite-sized chunks with a new topic on each page\
      Contains clear descriptions of syntax, each one demonstrated with inspiring code samples\
      Uses diagrams and photography to explain complex concepts in a visual way\
      By the end of the book, not only will you be able to use the thousands of scripts, JavaScript APIs, and jQuery plugins that are freely available on the web, and be able to customize them - you will also be able to create your own scripts from scratch.\
      If you're looking to create more enriching web experiences, then this is the book for you.",

Specifically, the font size is larger, and the page size is 7inx10in (the regular format uses 6inx9in).\n \
The content is identical.\n \
This is the Java version of our book. See our website for links to the C++ version.Have you ever...\n \
Wanted to work at an exciting futuristic company?\n \
Struggled with an interview problem thatcould have been solved in 15 minutes?\n \
Wished you could study real-world computing problems?\n \
If so, you need to read Elements of Programming Interviews (EPI).\n \
EPI is your comprehensive guide to interviewing for software development roles.\n \
The core of EPI is a collection of over 250 problems with detailed solutions. The problems are representative of interview questions asked at leading software companies. The problems are illustrated with 200 figures, 300 tested programs, and 150 additional variants.\n \
The book begins with a summary of the nontechnical aspects of interviewing, such as strategies for a great interview, common mistakes, perspectives from the other side of the table, tips on negotiating the best offer, and a guide to the best ways to use EPI. We also provide a summary of data structures, algorithms, and problem solving patterns.\n \
Coding problems are presented through a series of chapters on basic and advanced data structures, searching, sorting, algorithm design principles, and concurrency. Each chapter stars with a brief introduction, a case study, top tips, and a review of the most important library methods. This is followed by a broad and thought-provoking set of problems.",

He is coauthor of the leading textbook on computer algorithms, Introduction to Algorithms, which he wrote with Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein. The book, now in its third edition, has been translated into several languages. He is also the author of Algorithms Unlocked, a gentle introduction to understanding computer algorithms and how they relate to real-world problems. ##\

      lastName: "Kernighan",
      bio: "He worked at Bell Labs and contributed to the development of Unix alongside Unix creators Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie.\
      Kernighan's name became widely known through co-authorship of the first book on the C programming language with Dennis Ritchie. Kernighan affirmed that he had no part in the design of the C language ('it's entirely Dennis Ritchie's work').[6] He authored many Unix programs, including ditroff.\
      Kernighan is coauthor of the AWK and AMPL programming languages. The 'K' of K&R C and the 'K' in AWK both stand for 'Kernighan'.\
      In collaboration with Shen Lin he devised well-known heuristics for two NP-complete optimization problems: graph partitioning and the travelling salesman problem. In a display of authorial equity, the former is usually called the Kernighan–Lin algorithm, while the latter is known as the Lin–Kernighan heuristic.\
      Kernighan has been a Professor in the Computer Science Department of Princeton University since 2000. He is also the Undergraduate Department Representative",

      During this time, he has has written and co-authored over a dozen books on web design and programming.\
      Jon has not only written his his latest books HTML & CSS (design and build websites) and JavaScript & jQuery (interactive front end web development), but also designed the entire book from scratch. Dispensing with the traditional template of programming books, he wanted to present the information in a manner that is less intimidating and more relevant to those who have never tried to write code before. The result is a new, exciting way to learn about HTML, CSS and JavaScript presented in full-color, with plenty of info-graphics and photography that really make the title stand out from other books that cover the same topics."
